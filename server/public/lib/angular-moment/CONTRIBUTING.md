# Contributing Guide

Contributing to `angular-moment` is fairly easy. This document shows you how to
get the project, run all provided tests and generate a production ready build.

It also covers provided grunt tasks, that help you developing on `angular-moment`.

## Dependencies

To make sure, that the following instructions work, please install the following dependencies
on you machine:

- Node.js
- npm
- Git

If you install node through the binary installation file, **npm** will be already there.
When **npm** is installed, use it to install the needed npm packages:

`npm install -g grunt-cli bower`

## Installation

To get the source of `angular-moment` clone the git repository via:

`git clone https://github.com/urish/angular-moment`

This will clone the complete source to your local machine. Navigate to the project folder
and install all needed dependencies via **npm**:

`npm install`

Then install all the needed client-side dependencies via **bower**:

`bower install`

`angular-moment` is now installed and ready to be built.

## Building

`angular-moment` comes with a few **grunt tasks** which help you to automate
the development process. The following grunt tasks are provided:

#### grunt test

`grunt test` executes (as you might thought) the unit tests, which are located
in `tests.js`. The task uses the **karma** test runner to executes the tests with
the **jasmine testing framework**. This task also checks the coding using **jshint**.

#### grunt build

`grunt build` updates the minified version of the code (angular-moment.min.js). It also
checks the code using **jshint**.
