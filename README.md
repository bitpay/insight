# *insight*

*insight* is an open-source bitcoin blockchain explorer with complete REST
and websocket APIs. Insight runs in NodeJS, uses AngularJS for the
front-end and LevelDB for storage.

Check some screenshots and more details at [insight's project homepage](http://insight.bitcore.io).

*Insight* project is now splitted in two repositories. One for the [API](https://github.com/bitpay/insight-api) and for the front-end. This repository is for the front-end, which will install the API as a NPM dependency.

## Prerequisites

* **bitcoind** - Download and Install [Bitcoin](http://bitcoin.org/en/download)

*insight* needs a *trusted* bitcoind node to run. *insight* will connect to the node
thru the RPC API, Peer-to-peer protocol and will even read its raw .dat files for syncing.

Configure bitcoind to listen to RPC calls and set `txindex` to true.
The easiest way to do this is by copying `./etc/bitcoind/bitcoin.conf` to your
bitcoin data directory (usually `"~/.bitcoin"` on Linux, `"%appdata%\Bitcoin\"` on Windows, 
or `"~/Library/Application Support/Bitcoin"` on Mac OS X).

bitcoind must be running and must have finished downloading the blockchain **before** running *insight*.


* **Node.js v0.10.x** - Download and Install [Node.js](http://www.nodejs.org/download/).

* **NPM** - Node.js package manager, should be automatically installed when you get node.js.

## Quick Install
  Check the Prerequisites section above before installing.

  To install Insight, clone the main repository:

    $ git clone git@github.com:bitpay/insight.git && cd insight

  Install dependencies:

    $ npm install
    
  Run the main application:

    $ npm start
    
  Or just run:

    $ INSIGHT_PUBLIC_PATH=public node node_modules/insight-bitcore-api/insight.js

  Then open a browser and go to:

    http://localhost:3001

  Please note that the app will need to sync its internal database
  with the blockchain state, which may take some time. You can check
  sync progress from within the web interface.
   

## Configuration

All configuration is specified in the [config](config/) folder, particularly the [config.js](config/config.js) file. There you can specify your application name and database name. Certain configuration values are pulled from environment variables if they are defined:

### bitcoind connexion
```
BITCOIND_HOST         # RPC bitcoind host
BITCOIND_PORT         # RPC bitcoind Port
BITCOIND_P2P_PORT     # P2P bitcoind Port
BITCOIND_USER         # RPC username
BITCOIND_PASS         # RPC password
BITCOIND_DATADIR      # bitcoind datadir for livenet, or datadir/testnet3 for testnet
INSIGHT_NETWORK [= 'livenet' | 'testnet']
```

Make sure that bitcoind is configured to [accept incoming connections using 'rpcallowip'](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Running_Bitcoin).

In case the network is changed (testnet to livenet or vice versa) levelDB database needs to be deleted. This can be performed running:
```util/sync.js -D``` and waiting for *insight* to synchronize again.  Once the database is deleted, the sync.js process can be safely interrupted (CTRL+C) and continued from the synchronization process embedded in main app.

## Synchronization

The initial synchronization process scans the blockchain from the paired bitcoind server to update addresses and balances. *insight* needs one (and only one) trusted bitcoind node to run. This node must have finished downloading the blockchain befure running *insight*.

While *insight* is synchronizing the website can be accessed (the sync process is embedded in the webserver), but there may be missing data or incorrect balances for addresses. The 'sync' status is shown on the top-right of all pages. 

The blockchain can be read from bitcoind's raw `.dat` files or RPC interface. Reading the information from the `.dat` files is much faster so it's the recommended (and default) alternative. `.dat` files are scanned in the default location for each platform. In case a non-standard location is used, it needs to be defined (see the Configuration section). The synchronization type being used can be seen at the [Status page](http://localhost:3001/status).  As of February 2014, using `.dat` files the sync process takes 7 hrs. for livenet and 20 mins. for testnet.

While synchronizing the blockchain, *insight* listens for new blocks and transactions relayed by the bitcoind node. Those are also stored on *insight*'s database. In case *insight* is shutdown for a period of time, restarting it will trigger a partial (historic) synchronization of the blockchain. Depending on the size of that synchronization task, a reverse RPC or forward `.dat` syncing strategy will be used. 

If bitcoind is shutdown, *insight* needs to be stopped and restarted once bitcoind is restarted.

### Syncing old blockchain data manualy

  Old blockchain data can be manually synced issuing:

    $ util/sync.js

  Check util/sync.js --help for options, particulary -D to erase the current DB.

  *NOTE* that there is no need to run this manually since the historic synchronization is embedded on the web application, so by running you will trigger the historic sync automatically.


### DB storage requirement

To store the blockchain and address related information, *insight* uses LevelDB. Two DBs are created: txs and blocks. By default these are stored on 
  ```<insight root>/db``` 
  
this can be changed on config/config.js. As of February 2014, storing the livenet blockchain takes ~30GB of disk space (2GB for the testnet).

## Development

To run insight locally for development with grunt:

```$ NODE_ENV=development grunt```

To compile and minify the web application's assets:

```$ grunt compile```

## Web Socket API
The web socket API is served using [socket.io](http://socket.io) at:
```
  /socket.io/1/
```

Bitcoin network events published are:
'tx': new transaction received from network. Data will be a app/models/Transaction object.
Sample output:
```
{
  "txid":"00c1b1acb310b87085c7deaaeba478cef5dc9519fab87a4d943ecbb39bd5b053",
  "processed":false
  ...
}
```


'block': new block received from network. Data will be a app/models/Block object.
Sample output:
```
{
  "hash":"000000004a3d187c430cd6a5e988aca3b19e1f1d1727a50dead6c8ac26899b96",
  "time":1389789343,
  ...
}
```

'sync': every 1% increment on the sync task, this event will be triggered.

Sample output:
```
{
  blocksToSync: 164141,
  syncedBlocks: 475,
  upToExisting: true,
  scanningBackward: true,
  isEndGenesis: true,
  end: "000000000933ea01ad0ee984209779baaec3ced90fa3f408719526f8d77f4943",
  isStartGenesis: false,
  start: "000000009f929800556a8f3cfdbe57c187f2f679e351b12f7011bfc276c41b6d"
}
