# Insight

Project description.  

## Prerequisites
* Node.js v0.10.x - Download and Install [Node.js](http://www.nodejs.org/download/). You can also follow [this gist](https://gist.github.com/isaacs/579814) for a quick and easy way to install Node.js and npm, or the Ubuntu way: git clone git@github.com:joyent/node.git && cd node && git checkout v0.10.24 && ./configure && make && make install`
* MongoDB - Download and Install [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/downloads) - Make sure it's running on the default port (27017).
* Bitcoind - Download and Install [Bitcoin](http://bitcoin.org/en/download) - You should make sure to configure RPC security and `txindex`.  For an example, see `./etc/bitcoind/bitcoin.conf`

### Tools Prerequisites
* NPM - Node.js package manager, should be installed when you install node.js.
* Grunt - Download and Install [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com).
* Bower - Web package manager, installing [Bower](http://bower.io/) is simple when you have npm:

```
$ npm install -g bower
```

## Additional Packages
* Express - Defined as npm module in the [package.json](package.json) file.
* Mongoose - Defined as npm module in the [package.json](package.json) file.
* AngularJS - Defined as bower module in the [bower.json](bower.json) file.
* Twitter Bootstrap - Defined as bower module in the [bower.json](bower.json) file.

## Quick Install
  To install Insight on local, you have to fork the main repository to your
  computer:

    https://github.com/bitpay/insight

  Then clone it wherever you want:

    $ git clone git@github.com:<your_username>/insight.git && cd insight

  Install Grunt Command Line Interface:
  
    $ sudo npm -g install grunt-cli
  
  Install dependencies:

    $ npm install
    $ bower install

  We use [Grunt](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-cli) to start the server:

    $ grunt
    
  When not using grunt you can use (for example in production or test
  environment):

    $ node server
    
  Then open a browser and go to (with default port):

    http://localhost:3000

  If you get an error, please check the next section "Post-install"

## Syncing old blockchain data

  Run sync from insight repository (to save old blocks and transactions in MongoDB):
    
    $ utils/sync.js

  Check utils/sync.js --help for options.

  New blockchain data will be synced while the webserver (server.js) is up, through the p2p module.


## API

A REST API is provided at /api. The entry points are:


### Block
```
  /api/block/[:hash]
  /api/block/00000000a967199a2fad0877433c93df785a8d8ce062e5f9b451cd1397bdbf62
```
### Transaction
```
  /api/tx/[:txid]
  /api/tx/525de308971eabd941b139f46c7198b5af9479325c2395db7f2fb5ae8562556c
```
### Addresse
```
  /api/addr/[:addr]
  /api/addr/mmvP3mTe53qxHdPqXEvdu8WdC7GfQ2vmx5
```
### Transactions by Block
```
  /api/txs/?block=HASH
  /api/txs/?block=00000000fa6cf7367e50ad14eb0ca4737131f256fc4c5841fd3c3f140140e6b6
```
### Transactions by Address
```
  /api/txs/?address=ADDR
  /api/txs/?address=mmhmMNfBiZZ37g1tgg2t8DDbNoEdqKVxAL


### Sync status
```
  /api/sync
```

## Web Socket API
The web socket API is served using [socket.io](http://socket.io) at:
```
  /socket.io/1/
```

Bitcoin network events published are:
'tx': new transaction received from network. Data will be a app/models/Transaction object.
Sample output:
```
{
  "__v":0,
  "txid":"00c1b1acb310b87085c7deaaeba478cef5dc9519fab87a4d943ecbb39bd5b053",
  "_id":"52d68099c3fb4c240d000088",
  "orphaned":false,
  "processed":false
}
```


'block': new block received from network. Data will be a app/models/Block object.
Sample output:
```
{
  "__v":0,
  "hash":"000000004a3d187c430cd6a5e988aca3b19e1f1d1727a50dead6c8ac26899b96",
  "time":1389789343,
  "fromP2P":true,
  "_id":"52d6809ec3fb4c240d00008c"
}
```

'sync': every 1% increment on the sync task, this event will be triggered.

Sample output:
```
{
blocksToSync: 164141,
syncedBlocks: 475,
upToExisting: true,
scanningBackward: true,
isEndGenesis: true,
end: "000000000933ea01ad0ee984209779baaec3ced90fa3f408719526f8d77f4943",
isStartGenesis: false,
start: "000000009f929800556a8f3cfdbe57c187f2f679e351b12f7011bfc276c41b6d"
}
```

## Troubleshooting
If you did not get all library during grunt command, please use the follow command:

    $ bower install

## Configuration
All configuration is specified in the [config](config/) folder, particularly the [config.js](config/config.js) file and the [env](config/env/) files. Here you will need to specify your application name and database name.

### bitcoind

There is a bitcoind configuration sample at:
```
    etc/bitcoind/bitcoin.conf
```

If you want to use a external bitcoind server set:
  BITCOIND_HOST 
  BITCOIND_PORT         # RPC Bitcoind Port
  BITCOIND_P2P_PORT     # P2P Bitcoind Port 
  BITCOIND_USER 
  BITCOIND_PASS
  INSIGHT_NETWORK [= 'livenet' | 'testnet']

enviroment variables. Make sure that bitcoind is configured to accept incomming connections using 'rpcallowip' decribed in https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Running_Bitcoin. Alternatively change config/env/$NODE_ENV.js

In case the network is changed, mongoDB database need to be deleted. This can be performed running:
```
  util/sync.js -D
```


### Environment Variables Settings

There are three environments provided by default, __development__, __test__, and __production__. Each of these environments has the following configuration options:
* __db__ - This is the name of the MongoDB database to use, and is set by default to __insight-dev__ for the development environment.
* __app.name__ - This is the name of your app or website, and can be different for each environment. You can tell which environment you are running by looking at the TITLE attribute that your app generates.

To run with a different environment, just specify NODE_ENV as you call grunt:

	$ NODE_ENV=test grunt

If you are using node instead of grunt, it is very similar:

	$ NODE_ENV=test node server


### Development environment
To run insight locally for development:

  $ NODE_ENV=development grunt




### Production
You can use [pm2](https://github.com/Unitech/pm2) to manage NodeJS in production:

  $ npm install pm2 -g
  $ pm2 start insight.js
