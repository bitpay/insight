# Mystery

Project description.  

## Prerequisites
* Node.js - Download and Install [Node.js](http://www.nodejs.org/download/). You can also follow [this gist](https://gist.github.com/isaacs/579814) for a quick and easy way to install Node.js and npm
* MongoDB - Download and Install [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/downloads) - Make sure it's running on the default port (27017).

### Tools Prerequisites
* NPM - Node.js package manager, should be installed when you install node.js.
* Grunt - Download and Install [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com).
* Bower - Web package manager, installing [Bower](http://bower.io/) is simple when you have npm:

```
$ npm install -g bower
```

## Additional Packages
* Express - Defined as npm module in the [package.json](package.json) file.
* Mongoose - Defined as npm module in the [package.json](package.json) file.
* AngularJS - Defined as bower module in the [bower.json](bower.json) file.
* Twitter Bootstrap - Defined as bower module in the [bower.json](bower.json) file.
* UI Bootstrap - Defined as bower module in the [bower.json](bower.json) file.

## Quick Install
  The quickest way to get started with MEAN is to clone the project and utilize it like this:
  
  Grunt Command Line Interface:
  
    $ sudo npm -g install grunt-cli
  
  Install dependencies:

    $ npm install

  We use [Grunt](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-cli) to start the server:

    $ grunt
    
  When not using grunt you can use (for example in production):

    $ node server
    
  Then open a browser and go to:

    http://localhost:3000




## API

## Prerequisites
  Get bitcore from github repository:
    $ git clone https://github.com/bitpay/bitcore.git
    $ cd bitcore
    $ npm install
    
  Run sync from mystery repository:
    $ utils/sync.js

check utils/sync.js --help for options.

```





## Troubleshooting
If you did not get all library during grunt command, please use the follow command:

    $ bower install

## Configuration
All configuration is specified in the [config](config/) folder, particularly the [config.js](config/config.js) file and the [env](config/env/) files. Here you will need to specify your application name and database name.

### bitcoind

There is a bitcoind configuration sample at:
```
    etc/mystery/bitcoin.conf
```

If you want to use a external bitcoind server set BITCOIND_HOST / BITCOIND_PORT enviroment variables. Make sure that bitcoind is configured to accept incomming connections using 'rpcallowip' decribed in https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Running_Bitcoin.


### Environmental Settings

There are three environments provided by default, __development__, __test__, and __production__. Each of these environments has the following configuration options:
* __db__ - This is the name of the MongoDB database to use, and is set by default to __mystery-dev__ for the development environment.
* __app.name__ - This is the name of your app or website, and can be different for each environment. You can tell which environment you are running by looking at the TITLE attribute that your app generates.

To run with a different environment, just specify NODE_ENV as you call grunt:

	$ NODE_ENV=test grunt

If you are using node instead of grunt, it is very similar:

	$ NODE_ENV=test node server
